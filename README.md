React Native Take-home TVMaze

The main purpose of this project is to test what kind of solutions you can give to certain
day-to-day tasks and how well you can accomplish good practices. Do not aim to take the test in
the shortest possible time, but with the highest quality, you can achieve.
ASSIGNMENT
You will develop an application for listing TV series, using the API provided by the TVMaze website.
You can find the API here: TV API | TVmaze - Add TV information to your website or app.
Mandatory Features
List all of the series contained in the API used by the paging scheme provided by the API.
Allow users to search series by name.
The listing and search views must show at least the name and poster image of the series.
After clicking on a series, the application should show the details of the series, showing the following information:
Name, Poster, Genres, Summary
Days and time during which the series airs
List of episodes separated by season
After clicking on an episode, the application should show the episode’s information including:
Name, Number, Season, Summary, Image (if there is one)
Bonus (Optional)
Allow the user to save a series as a favorite.
Allow the user to delete a series from the favorites list.
Allow the user to browse their favorite series in alphabetical order, and click on one to
see its details.
Create a people search by listing the name and image of the person.
After clicking on a person, the application should show the details of that person, such as:
Name, Image and Series they have participated in, with a link to the series details.
Considerations
You can deliver an Android build OR an IOS build. You don’t have to deliver both, although if you do, it will be a plus
We will evaluate the technologies and libs that you will use, and how you use it
We will evaluate the UI / UX notion, so no interface design is presented. We do not expect a design masterpiece in your application, but
we want an application that respects the guidelines of the platform and that has no usability/performance issues.
Keep your code clean and well organized with best practices.
Follow the requested proposal. If you want to add new features to the app to make your project even better, complete all tasks first.
Unit testing is a plus.
Extra features are also a plus.
Deliverables

When you finish the assignment, generate the application APK or IPA, and place it into a distribution
folder. Then, share the repository link with your initial contact via email. Indicate which, if any, of
the bonus tasks you completed.
If you didn’t manage to finish everything, please tell us which parts you completed.
